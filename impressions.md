# First Steps
Started the hosts editor. It's fun. The compiler speed and integration with the VID/View lib is nice. It's easy to actually compile and get something runnig. The VS code syntax and building commands run well. It's a nice workflow with really minimal setup.

Some coding things seem a little weird and need getting used to. In the ui creation part, creating the different contorls and being able to assing them to variable in the same plase is really nice.

Error meesages were descriptive enough to find the problem. But googleing is a little bit of a pain. But it might be a good change of pace. The reference pages where enough to find a solution. It's a little bit more involved than finding the exact same question on stackoverflow. This could be a feature, not a bug.
